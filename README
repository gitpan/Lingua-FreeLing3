 Lingua-FreeLing3
------------------

This module is a wrapper around FreeLing 3.x C++ library. You can find
details on this library visiting their webpage:

INSTALLATION

The Build script tries to guess where your freeling 3 installation resides.
It tries the usual places for linux and Mac OS X operating systems.
If it desn't detect, export the FL_PREFIX environment variable with the prefix
used for your installation.

So, on most situations, you can:

   perl Build.PL

and if you need to specify the prefix, use

   FL_PREFIX=/path/to/freeling perl Build.PL

Then, run

   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install    # (as superuser)
