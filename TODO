 Needing a new and deeper look for FreeLing3:
  - ChartParser (still needed that hack?)
  - Deptxala (same, hack still needed?)
  - Nec (what was its state on FreeLing2?)

 
 Almost complete modules:
  - Word::Analysis                             (missing sense support)
  - Word                          (missing a lot of setters/selectors)
  - Sentence    (missing some selectors, and vector inherited methods)
  - Paragraph                                        (mostly complete)
  - MorphAnalyzer                                 (needs more testing)
  - RelaxTagger                                   (needs more testing)

 Incomplete modules:
  - Document
  - ParseTree (node)    (Problems when accessing leafs from parseTree)
  - ChartParser           (Complete if ParseTree would work correctly)
  - dep_txala

 Missing modules:
  - dep_tree  <-- not possible
  - fex
  - traces
  - nec
  - senses
  - disambiguator
  - sense_info
  - semanticDB

 Probably not needed:
  - VectorWord
  - ListWord
  - ListAnalysis
  - ListSentence
  - ListParagraph
  - ListString
  - ListInt
  - VectorListInt
  - VectorListString
  - TreeNode
  - TreeDepnode
  - dependency_parser
