=head1 NAME

Lingua::FreeLing3::EAGLES - Interface to parse EAGLES tagsets from FL3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Lingua::FreeLing3::EAGLES;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 NOTE: THIS MODULE IS NOT YET FUNCTIONAL

EAGLES-like tagets are easy to define, and most of them are kind of
easy to read by humans. However, there is not a clear algorithm to
parse all EAGLES tagsets, as the rules are too permissive.

This module defines an interface to easily obtain feature structures
from EAGLES tags.

=head2 Tagset Feature Structure

The homogeneous feature structure includes obligatorily a category
(C<<cat>> key). All other features might or not be present, depending
on the chosen language, and the supplied tag.

=head3 Categories

Categories (C<<cat>> key) are:

=over 4

=item C<noun>

a common noun.

=item C<name>

a proper noun.

=back

=head1 METHODS

This module exports only one method.

=head2 C<eagles>

The method used to extract details from an EAGLES tag.
